# Friendly-Reddit-Bot

As a Reddit user, I felt that creating some bots for some trivial jobs might be interesting. So, I started learning how to do that. Just made a simple bot to do a wholesome job using the `PRAW` library. 

Input your friends handle and the bot will reply to your friend's last 50 comments with a [Youtube link to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) song. Let your friend know that you are always there for him.

# How to run it

1. Install `praw`.
```
pip install praw
```

2. Modify `praw.ini` file as mentioned in [this blog](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) and save it in the same folder as the python codes.

3. Then just run this command from terminal.

```
python3 botname.py
```
And it will take a handle as input. Enter your friend's Reddit handle name and it will start it's job.

I would not be able to build these bots without reading [this blog](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) written by [Shantnu](https://github.com/shantnu). Thanks to him.
